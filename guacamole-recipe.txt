Chunky Guacamole

Ingredients:
3 Avocados
1/4 cup fresh Cilantro, minced
2 tbsp Onion, finely chopped
1 small Jalapeno Chile, stemmed, seeded and minced
1 clove Garlic, minced
1/2 tsp ground Cumin (Optional, but I always use it)
Salt
2 tbsp Lime Juice

Directions:
1) Halve 1 avocado, remove pit and scoop flesh into medium bowl.  
Mash flesh lightly with cilantro, onion, jalapeno, garlic, cumin and 1/4 tsp salt with fork, until just combined.

2) Halve, pit and cube remaining 2 avocados.  Add cuves to bowl with mashed avocado mixture.

3) Sprinkle lime juice over avocado cubes and mix lightly with fork until combined but still chunky.  
Season with salt to taste and serve (I never have to add extra salt).
